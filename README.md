**Business Objective**

A financial institution wants us to help them identify customers who have a lesser chance of defaulting on the loan.
The company management has asked the data science team to build a predictive model to identify who would be a good customer. Furthermore, they want the team to come up with questions to ask the client, based on the model, when they are applying for loan.
*Procedure*
Data Understanding
The dataset resembles a real-world dataset and has many of the same challenges. It has:
Missing values
Spelling differences
Punctuation format
Duplicates rows

Data Preparation
Split your data into training and testing
Start with Exploratory data analysis
Data cleaning
Handling the missing values
Transform categorical data into numeric
Feature Engineering (such as credit utilization)
The goal is to clean the dataset and get it ready for the Algorithms

Modeling

Algorithm Selection

Depending on the question at hand you can decide which algorithm
to choose

Classification Question
Pick a classification algorithm
Regression based
Tree based
Distance based
Probability based
Model Evaluation
Evaluation criteria

Modeling:
Pick an algorithm
Train the algorithm using training data
Evaluate the trained model
Use the trained model to predict who is a good customer
on test data
Come up with questions to ask the customer when they
apply for a loan
