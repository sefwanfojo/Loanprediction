Business Objective

A financial institution wants us to help them identify customers who have a lesser chance of defaulting on the loan.

The company management has asked the data science team to build a predictive model to identify who would be a good customer. Furthermore, they want the team to come up with questions to ask the client, based on the model, when they are applying for loan.
